# BuildWeek-4_15_19-BetterProfessor-Ui
UI Project

Page style will take inspiration from https://html5up.net/stellar

Guide for future devs:

-Index.html was the main page. For team.html, I copied the HTML from index.html, deleted all the feature divs, and put the team bios in that place instead. 

-You will need to use a LESS compiler, all CSS code was written in LESS files and then compiled.

-Team bio buttons are components created in team.js. 

-All icons and photos in "assets" folder.
